    Hello, my name is BlacK and you are reading the source code of my autistic ballistic table generator,
    before I go any further I would like to elaborate on few things, issues, why they exist, and laslty
    what we can possibly do about them.
    
    
    
    Issue 0001 - The ACF bullet simulation 
    
    In it's current state, ACF bullet simulation uses a variable called SysTime stored in the global table of ACF
    this variable is updated on every tick and can be found on line 243 in lua/autorun/acf_globals.lua
    Visit [https://github.com/nrlulz/ACF/blob/master/lua/autorun/acf_globals.lua#L243] for more info.
    
    ACF then uses this variable to determine how much time has passed since the last simulation step
    the bullet is then simulated up to the current time using the time between last simulation step and the current time
    as the delta time, while this sounds completely okay, it actually causes small discrepencies in the bullet's trajectory,
    when simulating the physics the delta time should always be a static number, that way the simulation would give same
    exact result every time, which is what we want and what's correct, sadly unless ACF developers decide to fix or
    recode the bullet flight simulation we are stuck with this messy simulation, thankfully for us the delta time 
    is or should always be somewhat same or close to server's tick interval or one divided by the current tickrate, the problem 
    is that if the server fails to process the tick in time or simply processes it in different way the bullet trajectory
    will change, the magnitude of this change then depends on how stable or unstable the processing time is.
    for sake of accuracy we are going to assume that the delta time is ALWAYS equal to tick interval as it should be.
    
    


    Issue 0002 - Calculating drag coefficient
    
    ACF Bullet simulation doesn't only simulate gravity but also aerodynamics, however, the way it's done isn't exactly
    good for this E2, on creation every bullet has a variable called DragCoef assigned to it together with few other variables.
    
    Our problem lays within how the value of this variable is calculated, the code looks at the frontal area of the bullet
    and divides it by ten thousand, the result of that math operation is then divided again by the bullet's mass, so what's wrong?
    
    Well the value of ten thousand is hardcoded into the bullet code and is specific for that bullet and it's code only, for example
    APHE shells have this value set to ten thousand but APDS shells have it set to twenty thousand, and sadly there is no way for us to grab
    this value, the best we can do is look at the name of the shell type being used, and look up it's frontal area divisor in a local table,
    the drawback of this is that if ACF devs add new ammo types that have this value set to something different than ten thousand or change
    this value for existing shells, our ballistic table will be useless as all it's values are completely wrong, the only way to fix this
    is adding the shell's frontal area divisor into the table manually by looking at the shell's source code or guessing.
    
    DEVELOPER NOTE: I found out that there's a network var on the shell called "DragCoef" but I can't access it because I don't know how, help!
    DEVELOPER NOTE 2: I just noticed that they misspelled the variable's name, it's FrAera and not FrArea lol.

    Visit [https://github.com/nrlulz/ACF/blob/master/lua/acf/shared/rounds/roundap.lua#L36] for more info.
    You can also visit [https://github.com/nrlulz/ACF/tree/master/lua/acf/shared/rounds] for a list of all official shell types.
    
    
    Now to teach you a bit on how to use this, first you will need this beautiful function.
 
    function vector2 getBallisticData(Distance:number)
    {
        local Integral = Distance / Globals["m_flIncrementDist", number]
        local Lower = Ballistics[floor(Integral), vector2]
        local Upper = Ballistics[ceil(Integral), vector2]
        local Set = Lower + (Upper - Lower) * (Integral - floor(Integral))
        
        return Set
    }
    
    now that you have this function you might be wondering on how to use it, well its simple!
    simply get the distance from your gun's muzzle to where you are trying to shoot and pass it
    into this function as argument, the function will return a vector2 containing velocity of the projectile
    and bullet drop, Example code:
    
    local BallisticData = getBallisticData(DistanceToTarget)
    local BulletVelocity = BallisticData:x()
    local BulletDrop = vec(0, 0, BallisticData:y())

if (first() | dupefinished())
{
    #[[
    Okay so in ACF source code sv_gravity:GetInt() is used to get the force of gravity, however
    Expression2's convarnum() function might be returning results of GetFloat() or GetDouble().

    What I'm trying to say here is that this will work as long as you are not playing on autistic server
    where for whatever reason the server operator decided to set Gravity to something like 600.99876464.

    Okay so here it is, as stated in Issue 0002, this table contains all frontal area divisors
    that I could find, it contains even some extra ammo types that I found on ACF servers.
    
    TODO: This is so fucking disgusting I hope I'm never gonna have to write E2 for ACF again.
